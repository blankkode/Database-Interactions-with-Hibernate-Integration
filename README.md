# Database-Interactions-with-Hibernate-Integration

In this task, we will learn about the Hibernate framework and how to interact with a database using it.
To complete the task, you need to:
Familiarize yourself with Hibernate. You can learn more about Hibernate Here.
Use the previous task's project as a starting point.

Task Description:
In the previous task, we worked with Maven and JDBC to enhance an application that interacts with a database.
This time, we will focus on the UserHibernateDaoImpl class, which implements the same interface as UserDaoJdbcImpl.
In this task, you need to implement database interaction using Hibernate in the UserHibernateDaoImpl class and complete its methods, and then test them using the JUnit test cases provided in the project.

Requirements for application classes:
UserHibernateDaoImpl should implement the UserDao interface.
The Util class should be configured for Hibernate (next to JDBC) without using XML.
The Service class should use the Hibernate implementation of the dao.
The methods for creating and deleting the User table in the UserHibernateDaoImpl class should be implemented using SQL.
The application algorithm and operations remain unchanged compared to the previous task.

Please, submit the link to the GitHub repository with the solution to the task.
